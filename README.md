# HomeworkWeek5

this is my README for my week 5 homework. this weeks project was an application of a daily schedule for the hours from 9-5.
every hour is color coded to show which hour is present, past, and future corresponding to the time the page was loaded.
upon loading, the current date will also display in the header.
the application allows the user to type into the timeslots of every hour and make a daily planner.
upon hitting save next to the corresponding timeslot, the text will be stored in the local storage.
this text will be rendered upon reloading or loading into the page on a later date.
